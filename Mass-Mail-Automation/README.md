# Mass Emailer

## Project Overview
**Mass Emailer** is a Python-based application designed to send bulk emails efficiently using an SMTP server. Leveraging the power of the **Tkinter** library for the graphical user interface (GUI), this tool provides a user-friendly platform for managing and dispatching large volumes of emails with ease.

## Objectives
- **Bulk Email Sending**: Facilitate the sending of large numbers of emails simultaneously.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Utilize Tkinter to create an intuitive and accessible GUI.
- **SMTP Integration**: Seamlessly connect with SMTP servers to handle email delivery.
- **Customization**: Allow users to personalize email content and recipient lists.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust mechanisms to manage and report errors during the email-sending process.

## Features
- **Import Recipient Lists**: Load recipients from CSV or Excel files.
- **Personalized Emails**: Customize email content with placeholders for dynamic data.
- **Attachment Support**: Attach files to emails as needed.
- **Scheduling**: Schedule emails to be sent at specific times.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor the status and progress of email dispatch.
